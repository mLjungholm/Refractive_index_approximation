Workflow for the graded refractive index calculation project.

Discription:
    The project aims to create a program that can estimate the graded
refractive index in small objects by importing a stack if interference 
microscopy images and using an itterative raytracing to find the refractive
index.


Components:

Defining volume:
    % Importing images              - Lost
    % Selecting area of interest    - Lost
    % Aligning images               - Postponed
    % Finding borders
    % Defining size
    % Defining center line
    % Defining slices

Refractive index calculation:
    % Creating phase shift profile fom image stack
    % Initial refractive index aproximation from phase shift values
    % Itterative ray tracing
    % Full body analysis and extrapolation

Test data and Models:
    % Create a set of geometrical "analytical" shapes
        - 2D    - Complete
        - 3D
    % Create GRIN volumes with known refractive index
        - 2D    - Complete
        - 3D
    % Create a PDS for the two and 3 dim case
        - 2D    - partial (only circular shapes)
        - 3D
    % Simulate phase shift maps for the known shapes/GRINs
        - 2D
        - 3D
